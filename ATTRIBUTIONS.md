# Attributions
This project wouldn't be possible without the amazing libraries included in it such as [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) and [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/)

## Popper.js & Tippy.js
These two libraries make it possible to have an interactive pop up element for authors. This is crucial for providing a clean and simple interface for viewing the authors of a module along with any specific links or information they provide.
